  # The two things Windows can do that Electron cannot reach: capturing one
  # application's sound, and watching one key while the app is in the
  # background. Separate addons, sharing nothing but this file — a machine that
  # cannot load one has no reason to lose the other.
  #
  # Capturing one application's sound on Windows.
  #
  # WHY a native addon at all: Electron's screen share reply takes
  # `audio: "loopback"`, which means the default render device — the whole
  # machine. There is nothing per-window or per-application in it, and the
  # WebFrameMain form captures one of our own frames rather than somebody
  # else's program. Windows itself can do this, through WASAPI process
  # loopback, and nothing in Electron reaches that API.
  #
  # It builds everywhere so that `npm install` on Linux and macOS is not a
  # failure. There is simply nothing to capture there: those platforms compile
  # a stub whose start() throws, and the Linux screen share has its own route
  # to the same end anyway — see app/main/linux-audio-share.ts.
