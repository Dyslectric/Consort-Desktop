// A shutter in front of the microphone, closed unless push to talk says
// otherwise.
//
// WHY not just mute the call: because the call's mute button is the user's, and
// this is not. A gate that worked by pressing that button would fight whoever
// pressed it last — releasing the key would un-mute somebody who had muted
// themselves, and muting yourself would be silently undone by the next press.
// Worse, in a call the mute state is *published*: the other participants see a
// microphone icon flicker on and off with every syllable, and the server sees a
// stream of presence updates for something that is nobody else's business.
//
// So the gate sits one layer in front. The microphone track a call receives is
// not the microphone: it is the output of a gain node this controls, with the
// real capture feeding it. Two shutters in series, and the sound gets out only
// if both are open — the call's mute button on top, doing exactly what it did
// before and knowing nothing about any of this, and push to talk underneath.
//
// It also means the level a call reads for its speaking indicator is the gated
// level. Holding a conversation with somebody in the room while the key is up
// lights nothing up at the far end, which is the promise push to talk makes and
// which muting-by-pressing-the-button could not keep.
//
// The injection route is the one linux-display-audio.ts documents at length: the
// wrapper runs in the page's own world, in every frame, evaluated from here.
// Neither the preload nor the main process can reach the object that matters —
// contextIsolation puts the preload's `navigator` somewhere no page code looks,
// a preload runs in the main frame while a call is a cross-origin iframe, and
// nothing in the main process holds a MediaStream at all.
