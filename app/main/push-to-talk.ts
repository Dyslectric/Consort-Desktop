// the page. This is the half that watches the key — see native/src/hotkey-win.cc
// for why that takes an addon — and the small amount of arbitration between
// them: what happens when the key is rebound mid-press, when the machine sleeps
// with a finger on it, and when a release goes missing.
//
// Windows only, for now. The key has to be watched while the app is in the
// background, which on Linux means either an X11-only hook that Wayland has
// deliberately closed off or a portal that does not exist yet; the answer there
// is a separate program gating the microphone for the whole machine rather than
// anything this file could grow into. See docs/push-to-talk.md.
