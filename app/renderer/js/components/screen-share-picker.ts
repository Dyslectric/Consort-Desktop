 Ask which application's sound should go with a share.

 Used on Wayland, where the desktop's own dialog chose the video and the app's
 picker — which carries this choice everywhere else — never appeared. Only when
 the machine could not work the answer out for itself: a screen share takes
 everything and a window share takes the window's own application, so what
 reaches here is genuinely several applications and no way to tell which.

 The share is held behind this answer, because the sound can only join the video
 before the call is handed it — and there is no second route to fall back on any
 more. Not held indefinitely, though: after a while the video goes without sound
 rather than leaving somebody looking at a share that never began, and answering
 after that says so instead of quietly doing nothing.
